## Definition of Terms
- What is Git and GitHub desktop?
Git is a widely used version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your code. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage your Git repositories. With GitHub, you can back up your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.

- Git Bash
- local directory
- remote or remote directory

## Specifics
- Initialize a normal directory to be a git repo
  - Create a folder in your local directory
    ~~~
    $ cd new_dir
    ~~~
    - '$ cd new_dir' this command allows you to move to the new folder in your local directory.

    ~~~
    '$ git init'
    ~~~
    ![img_3.png](images/img_3.png)
  - Do some changes in your new directory
    - Be gay, do your craft.
    ~~~
      $ git status
    ~~~
    - '$ git status' after doing your thing check the status of your repo. This might say untracked files, so you have to add it.
    ![img_4.png](images/img_4.png)
    ~~~
      $ git add README.md
    ~~~
    - The README.md here is just a sample file which I added. *If you want to add (track) all the untracked file you can just use period (.)*
    ~~~
    $ git add .
    ~~~

  - Commit (secure save) the changes you did on your local repo. *NOTE: Before you can push anything to your remote directory (repository) you have to commit those files.*
    - But first, do you want to know why it's important to commit your files as often in git? Here's why: 
      - https://medium.com/@tournetorres/git-why-is-it-important-to-commit-130c3890e582
    ~~~
    $ git commit -m "Initialized Git Repo" -m "Initialized local dir to Git master. Added README.md"
    ~~~
    - *NOTE: Be mindful of your current branch when committing changes.*

      - git - standard gitbash script to call git.
      - commit - script to commit
      - -m "Title, description, or any message" - dash m is the shorthand notation for message. 
        - If you were to look on the GitHub Desktop interface for commit, there's title and description. 
      ![img.png](images/img.png)
        - Same goes with the CLI command, the first -m is for the title/summary and the second -m is for the description.
  - Additional: If you haven't pushed your last commit yet, you can simply amend it to your last commit if it goes the same version of your progress. The command given above is without messages. You can use the git commit â€“amend command to edit a commit message. To do so, use the -m flag and specify a new commit message in quotation marks.
  ~~~
  $ git commit --amend
  ~~~
  or
  ~~~
  $ git commit --amend -m "Smth to change title" -m "Smth to change desciption"
  ~~~
  ![git commit --amend](images/img_6.png)

- Pushing to the Git Repository
  - Whenever there's changes you've done commiting, you need to push it in the remote repository to be available for the other user/member of that repository to see your changes. 
  - To push, make sure there were changes committed. If no changes committed, then there's actually no need to push anything. For this example,I committed something the last edit for pushed and titled it "Added Push Guide" with description "Added partial guide on how to Push in the git repository."
![](images/img_8.png)
  - Take a look at this GitHub repo update I got the last time. The last push was witten 7days ago from the writing of this guide.  
![](images/img_7.png)
  - If we were to compare the details we had from our last commit today [GitHub desktop] versus the details we saw in the GitHub repo, the update in the GitHub repo was 7 days late. It means that our latest commit wasn't committed yet in our remote GitHub repo. 
  - '$ git push origin master' command allows you to push to the origin/master branch. *NOTE: 'master' can also be 'main' it really depends on the default repository you have.*
  ~~~
  $ git push origin master
  ~~~
  - The use of upstream or shorthand -u helps us to push to our upstreamed directory. To do this we can just use the command 
  ~~~
  $ git push -u origin master 
  ~~~
  - By the next time we push, we can now use just the git push command. It will automatically be pushed on our upstreamed directory.
  ~~~
  $ git push
  ~~~
